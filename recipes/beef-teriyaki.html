        <h2>What is Beef Teriyaki?</h2>
             <p>Thin ribeye steaks marinated with teriyaki seasoning, then pan-sear them until slightly charred.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>beef ribeye steaks</strong> – each ½ inch, 1.25 cm thick</li>
                <li><strong>neutral oil</strong> – to cook the steaks</li>
                <li><strong>Japanese soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, and fresh ginger juice (from grated ginger)</strong> – for the sauce and marinade</li>
                <li><strong>green onion/scallion and toasted white sesame seeds</strong> – for the garnish</li>
                <li><strong>optional potato starch or cornstarch and water</strong> – for a slurry to thicken the sauce, if you wish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the teriyaki sauce ingredients in a bowl. Mix well to dissolve the sugar.</li>
                <li>Marinate the steaks in some of the teriyaki sauce for 30 minutes in the fridge.</li>
                <li>Bring the steaks to room temperature before cooking and pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
                <li>Heat the teriyaki sauce in a large pan and simmer for 15 seconds. (For an optional thick sauce, add a starch slurry and whisk until thickened.) Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Cooks the steaks in a preheated cast-iron skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Pour the teriyaki sauce over the steaks. The sauce gets bubbly and gives the steaks a nice glaze.</li>
                <li>Remove the steaks to a plate before the sauce starts to burn. Rest the steaks for 5–10 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
