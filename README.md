Hi, Im Tongo. This will be my very first project for web development. 
Let's anticipate for the result. 

Key points:
    3 recipes.html goes into Recipe Dir. 
        beef-teriyaki.html
        miso-soup.html
        shisho-garlic-pasta.html
    <h1>, use recipe name as title 
    Link recipes to Index.html <a href=""> title </a>
